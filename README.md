Mood Tracker Java Project
Project Overview

The Mood Tracker is a console-based Java application that allows users to track, edit, and manage their daily moods. The app demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Collections, Date & Time APIs, and File I/O in Java.

Learning Objectives:

After completing this project, you will be able to:

Create classes and objects using OOP concepts.

Use ArrayLists to store and manage objects in memory.

Work with LocalDate and LocalTime to track date and time.

Implement File I/O operations to persist data.

Handle exceptions and input validation in Java applications.
